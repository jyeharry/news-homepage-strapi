# news-homepage-strapi

## Overview

This project contains an [Astro](https://astro.build/) frontend in `./client/` and a Strapi CMS in `./cms/`. The client is mostly copied over from [github.com/jyeharry/news-homepage](https://github.com/jyeharry/news-homepage) which is my solution to a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge. The differences between this client and the client for the Frontend Mentor challenge are a few changes in this client to fetch the content from the CMS and to use Astros Content Collection API.

This site and CMS have not been deployed since there would be no reasonable difference to the user between this version and the one in [github.com/jyeharry/news-homepage](https://github.com/jyeharry/news-homepage). Head there to find the links to the deployed client.
