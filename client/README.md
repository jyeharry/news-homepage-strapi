# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is a solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This version of this challenge is a clone of my previous solution to this challenge. The difference in this repo being that this repo contains a CMS that houses the content for the site. This version is not the version submitted to Frontend Mentor. That can be found at [github.com/jyeharry/news-homepage](https://github.com/jyeharry/news-homepage).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - SSG framework

### What I learned

Astro was a nice change from what I'm used to. It was fairly easy to learn while also being quite powerful in what it can do.

I like that you can use yml style frontmatter to import modules and fetch data to be used in that files component, while also using vanilla js script tags in the same component for interactivity.

Styling actually took some getting used to since it makes use of scoped styles whereas previously I was using a global stylesheet containing Cube/BEM CSS classnames.

It was also my first time in a long time making a responsive nav component which was a fun challenge. I also used container queries for the first time ever and I can already see how useful they are.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue working with Astro as I can see it being a very useful and efficient way of building sites, particularly static ones. I also plan on copying my solution and implementing some headless CMS's into it to get a feel of which CMS I'd like to use the most when working with Astro or any other sites for that matter.

### Useful resources

- [Astro's official docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)
- [Kevin Powell's solution to this challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thudicbgqtg) - While I made my best efforts to complete this challenge on my own where I could, I looked to Kevin's solution for inspiration on the parts that I found a little trickier.
